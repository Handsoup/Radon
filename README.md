# Radon

This project implements Radon transform and its inverse in C++ for medical imaging applications.

It even has a usefull csv reader writer header for future projects and vector methods too 

This project has the following parts:
1. Radon transform class that makes doing the Radon transform possible
2. The Inverse Radon Transform class that makes the Inverse Radon Transform possible
3. The FilterWHeel class that offers opencv matrix compatible filtering solutions. (Currently only the Sepp-Logan filter is implemented)
